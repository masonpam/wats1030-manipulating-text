I think the easiest for me to use was emacs.  It took a little bit to get used to the key combinations but once I was able to figure it all out, and the cheat sheet helped too, it was pretty easy.  It was the easiest for me to switch between files.  I tried Nano next and I found it was confusing to me as to which files I was editing, I ended up putting all my edits in one file accidentally.  It was useful having the commands listed out on the bottom though.  Vi was last and it was the hardest to get used to for me.  It was a lot harder to figure things out and it was a lot more complicated to use.
